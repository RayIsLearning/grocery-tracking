# grocery-tracking
This application combines C++ and Python to track grocery inventory via file handling.
This was done by building a menu with C++ and using regex expressions in Python to track sales occurances.
I developed workable code using different languages.
I could expand upon the starter code provided provided by the university to make it run smoother to improve this application in the future.
Linking the two languages was the hardest part of this project.
Combining languages is a valuable skill that I can apply to future projects.
I made the code readable by including many detailed comments on what the code does.
